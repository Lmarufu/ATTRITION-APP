# Customer-Churn-Prediction-App
This repository is focused on developing a user-friendly customer churn prediction app using Streamlit for embedding ML models. Enables non-technical stakeholders to utilize models effortlessly. Repository includes preprocessing, model training scripts, and Streamlit setup for easy deployment.

### Customer Churn Prediction App
Overview
This Streamlit web application aims to provide insights and predictions related to customer churn. It utilizes various data visualization techniques and machine learning models to analyze customer data and predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not.



## **Project Title:** Churn Prediction Dashboard for Vodafone Corporation

## **Description:**
The Churn Prediction Dashboard for Vodafone Corporation aims to address customer retention challenges by leveraging machine learning and interactive visualization techniques. The project follows a systematic approach, outlined below:

1. # **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Obtain historical customer data from Vodafone Corporation's database.
   - Preprocess the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.

2. # **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Develop an EDA dashboard using Streamlit, allowing users to explore various demographic and service-related factors influencing churn.
   - Visualize churn patterns, service usage, contract terms, payment methods, and other relevant factors.

3. # **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Dashboard:**
   - Implement a dashboard to display key performance indicators such as churn rate, average tenure, monthly charges, total revenue, and data size.
   - Enable stakeholders to monitor and track important metrics related to customer churn.

4. # **Machine Learning Model Training:**
   - Train machine learning models, including logistic regression and SGD classifiers, on historical customer data to predict churn.
   - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and techniques.

5. # **Prediction Dashboard:**
   - Develop a prediction dashboard where users can input customer information, such as demographic details, service usage, and contract terms.
   - Utilize pre-trained machine learning models to provide real-time churn predictions.
   - Display the probability of churn and interpret the results for users.

6. # **Prediction History Display:**
   - Create a page to display the history of previous churn predictions made through the dashboard.
   - Enable users to review past predictions and monitor prediction trends over time.

## **Technical Stack:**
- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

## **Usage:**
1. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Run the `main.py` file to launch the Streamlit application.
3. Navigate through the different pages to explore EDA, KPIs, make predictions, and view prediction history.

## **Future Improvements:**
- Integration of additional machine learning models for churn prediction.
- Enhancements to the user interface for improved user experience.
- Incorporation of additional data sources to enhance prediction accuracy.
